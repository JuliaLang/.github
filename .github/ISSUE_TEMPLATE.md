If you have a question please search or post to our Discourse site: https://discourse.julialang.org.
We use the GitHub issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests only.

If you're submitting a bug report, be sure to include as much relevant information as
possible, including:

1. The output of `versioninfo()`
2. How you installed Julia
3. A minimal working example (MWE), also known as a minimum reproducible example

If you're experiencing a problem with a particular package, open an issue on that
package's repository instead.

Thanks for contributing to the Julia project!
